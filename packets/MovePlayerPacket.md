# MovePlayerPacket

__ID: 19__

For client authoritative and server authoritative movement modes, it is only intended as a client-bound packet. It forces the player to a specified position with slightly different behavior depending on the position mode. For similar packets that move the player, see also: - CorrectPlayerMovePredictionPacket (server authoritative) - SetActorMotionPacket

<tr><td>On Ground</td><td><table><tbody><tr><td>bool</td><td>For client bound packets this should have little meaning as it will be reset by the client every frame. For server bound it is true if the player is currently touching the ground. This is indicated by physics trying to move the player down and being stopped by collision. If the player falls freely or moves up it is cleared. If the player isn't affected by gravity this will stay at whatever value it had. The server authoritative near-equivalent of this is PlayerAuthInputPacket::InputData::VerticalCollision</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>
